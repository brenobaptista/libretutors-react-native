# LibreTutor - Pupil App
LibreTutor's pupil app made using React Native (Android and iOS).

# What does this app do?

Currently, this app is under development. It's got a login screen, 
a working main screen (map and search components) and a chatroom 
screen (not working though).

# For the future

In the future, I will integrate authentication using the API and 
make the chatroom work using ChatKit by Pusher.

# How can I contribute to this open-source project?
